# Introduction

Today we will learn how to handle database connections from the PHP applications. We will use lightweight file-based SQL database called [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org). We will learn how to:

1. Connect to the database
2. Get data
3. Get filtered data
4. Insert data
5. Active record

Good luck!

## Table of contents
* [Connecting to DB]({{%relref "connecting/_index.md"%}})
* [Getting all data]({{%relref "connecting2/_index.md"%}})
* [Data filtering using SQL]({{%relref "filtering/_index.md"%}})
* [Adding new data to database]({{%relref "adding/_index.md"%}})
* [Playing with ActiveRecord]({{%relref "activerecord/_index.md"%}})
