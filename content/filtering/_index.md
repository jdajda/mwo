Extend your code so that you can filter the list using name, surname and email. The filter should check for any occurances of the given keyword in given field. Check the example below:

![](/db4.gif)

# Hints

1. For filtering you can use `LIKE` SQL operator. 
1. Don't forget to set previous values for the form fields, like this: `value="<?=$name?>"`
